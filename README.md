My name is José Eustaquio from Brasil (🇧🇷). I have been working as a front-end and back-end developer since 2001 and I am currently studying Information Systems at [COTEMIG] (https://cotemig.com.br). In this academic phase I develop projects proposed by the masters to improve my knowledge and my GitHub profile.

In my free time I like to watch soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to reflect on life with a glass of wine (🍺).
